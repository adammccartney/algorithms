Binary tree
===========

Toy binary tree implementation that uses Knuth's algorithm for in order
traversal. Note that all memory management is the responsibility of the caller.

Exposes a single function:

```c
void traverseInorder(binarytree *t, stack *s);
```

(being a c novice, it actually it exposes more, please try not to stare)
